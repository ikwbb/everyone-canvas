**Everyone's Canvas** is a real-time, collaborative drawing web application where users from around the world can draw, doodle, and share ideas on a shared, finite canvas. Built with Node.js, Express, and Fabric.js, this project offers a simple yet powerful platform for creative collaborationâ€”no registration required!

## Features

- **Collaborative Drawing**: Draw, erase, and edit on a shared canvas with others in real-time.
- **Finite Canvas**: Work within a fixed 854x480 pixel space for a focused experience.
- **Drawing Tools**: Includes pencil, spray, eraser, undo/redo, and selection tools.
- **Customizable Brushes**: Adjust brush width for drawing, erasing, and spraying.
- **Save & Load**: Persist canvas state to the server and load it on startup.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Bootstrap for a clean, mobile-friendly interface.
- **No Sign-Up Needed**: Jump right in and start drawing!
